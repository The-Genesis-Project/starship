A very interesting and useable language. It's going to be the foundation of future projects. My goal is to create a microkernel written in this language. What's it called? I dunno. 

Example useage:

```
fn main(x: int, y: int) -> int {
    int test = 123;
    test = 456;
    print(test);
    return 0;
}
```

It will likely be stronger typed later on.

Features:
JIT? Never heard of her.
Safety? Never heard of her.

I will expand this readme later on... i'm sure.
I plan to work on the doxygen, so you'll be able to read through that, when I have start work on something like a standard library.
